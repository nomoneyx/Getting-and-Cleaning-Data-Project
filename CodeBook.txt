Code Book - run_analysis.R
==========================
R program run_analysis.R produces the data frame tidy_means.  Data contained within tidy_means was produced from experiments
carried out by 30 volunteers wearing Samsung Galaxy S II smartphones.  Each smartphone recorded 3-axial linear acceleration 
and 3-axial angular velocity using an embedded accelerometer and gyroscope.   Below is the name and a description of the files 
produced from the experiments and how they were used to produce the tidy_means data frame.

Original files:
===============
- 'features.txt': Discriptive list of all features variables which represent data collected from the Samsung accelerometer and gyroscope
- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name, WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING.
- 'train/X_train.txt': Numeric values recorded by the Samsung smartphones in the training group.
- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels. Intergers representing volunteers participating in the experiments from the training group.
- 'test/X_test.txt': Numeric values recorded by the Samsung smartphones in the test group.
- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels. Intergers representing volunteers participating in the experiments from the test group.

Transformations used to produce tidy_means:
===========================================
- Above files were imported into R v3.1.1 using rStudio.
- 'test/y_test.txt' and train/y_train.txt along with 'activity_labels.txt' were used to construct vectors that contained descriptive variable names 
   for the activities preformed in the experiments.
-  'test/X_test.txt','test/y_test.txt', and vectors containing descriptions of activities preformed where combined horizontally to form a data frame.
-  'test/X_train.txt','test/y_train.txt', and vectors containing descriptions of activities preformed where combined horizontally to form a data frame.
-  Both of the data frames produced in the two previous lines were joined vertically to produce a data frame containing both test and training data.
-  Column names were produced using 'features.txt' and other descriptive variable names and were added to the combined data frame
-  A nested for loop was used to calculate the column means of the combined data frame and populate the tidy_means data frame with the results.

Variables of tidy_means data frame:
===================================

"Activity"

Activity preformed by each volunteer while wearing a smart phone on their waste
Type - character  Levels - WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING

"Volunteer"

Number representing a single volunteer participating in the experiments
Type - interger Range - [1:30]


The following variables were produced from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. 
These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using 
a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the 
acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another 
low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and 
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, 
tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, 
fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

Mean and standard deviation of these values were calculated and are represented by mean () and std () contained in the description
of the variable. 

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:
